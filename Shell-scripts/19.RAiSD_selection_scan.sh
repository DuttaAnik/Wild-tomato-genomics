# RAiSD selection scan method estimates the Î¼ statistic, a composite evaluation test that scores genomic regions by quantifying changes in the SFS, the levels of LD, and the amount of genetic diversity along a chromosome. 
# I am running the RAiSD using the full vcf now which contains 30080652 SNPs (merged.vcf with 12 scaffolds). And I also discarded the missing SNPs.
# -y is ploidy level (diploid 2) 
# -M 0 (discards SNP missing data)
# -c 1 (Provides the slack for the SFS edges to be used for the calculation of mu_SFS. The default value is 1 (singletons and S-1 snp class, where S is the sample size))
# -w 50 (Provides the window size (integer value). The default value is 50 (empirically determined).
# -A 0.999 (significance threshold to define regions under selection, here 99.9%). With this option, a manhattan plot is generated automatically.
